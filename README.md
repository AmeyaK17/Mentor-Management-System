# Mentor-Management-System

Mentor meeting is an opportunity to seek advice and guidance. So in order to make it more efficient by digitalising it by making a system where students and teachers can hold an account and can communicate with each other more effectively. 		


This entire work of creating and designing the system is done on a linux based computer system using the programming language python and various libraries that comes with it.		


This project disscusses on the standardized authentic model regarding a mentoring system , a system which will have various features. This includes features such as scheduling a mentor meeting, maintaining a record of proceedings that take place in the meeting and the summary of the whole  meeting and a few others.		


This would help bring a change by not spending time in printing the place, date, time, topic etc. This directly provides the information of the meeting within few time of declaring it so that its available to both students and faculty in a handy way rather than printing a notice about it.
